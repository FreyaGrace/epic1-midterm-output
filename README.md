# Mandala arts
For this project, I created two kinds of mandala design one is a mandala design of a sun and the other is of a sakura flower.
# Sakura flower
I chose this kind of design because I was inspired by the japanese animes and was intrigued by it's meaning and representation. The sakura represents the time of renewal, the new begining, hope and optimism because the cherry tree in japan only blooms for a short time which always signalled the beginning of spring. The cherry blossom are also a symbol of  life and death which symbolizes the fragility of life because the japanese believe that something is beautiful because it has an end.

I used simple shapes such as pentagon, circles and triangle to give petals an irregular and unique shape with striking appearance and used hexagram for the stamens of the flower which could also resembles as the union of heavens and earth. I also used the color platte of a cherry blossom tree to attract attention and to resemble the sakura flower.
