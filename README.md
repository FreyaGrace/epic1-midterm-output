# Mandala arts
Mandalas are circular designs with repeating shapes and with symbolic pictures of the universe, often used in the performance of sacred rites and as an instrument of meditation.
And for this project, I created two kinds of mandala design one is a mandala design of a sun and the other is of a sakura flower.
# Sakura flower
I chose this kind of design because I was fascinated by Japanese anime and was intrigued by its meaning and representation. The Sakura represents the time of renewal, the new beginning, hope, and optimism because the cherry tree in Japan only blooms for a short time, which always signals the beginning of spring and the fiscal year. The cherry blossom is also a symbol of life and death, which symbolizes the fragility of life because the Japanese believe that something is beautiful because it has an end.
I used simple shapes such as pentagons, circles, and triangles to give petals an irregular and unique shape and a nanogram for the stamens, which could also resemble the Bahai symbol of the nine-pointed star, which represents perfection and unity. I also used the color palette of a cherry blossom tree to attract attention and resemble the sakura flower.
# Sun
The sun is the source of life. Even if all the other elements, such as water, air, and fire, are present, there can be no life without the sun.
The moon and all other planets look up to the sun for light. On earth, plants need the sunâ€™s heat and warmth to thrive.
The sun warms and illuminates the habitats of animals big and small. Large portions of the human population depend on the sun for subsistence.
As a source and giver of life, the sun symbolizes the determination to live. 
That is why I chose this kind of design.
By manipulating shapes and lines and using different sources and references from YouTube, I created this mandala with the intent to replicate the sun with the flower of life to symbolize life and determination.
