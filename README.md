# Mandala arts
Mandalas are circular designs with repeating shapes with symbolic pictures of the universe, often used in the performance of sacred rites and as an instrument of meditation.
And for this project, I created two kinds of mandala design one is a mandala design of a sun and the other is of a sakura flower.
# Sakura flower
I chose this kind of design because I was inspired by the japanese animes and was intrigued by it's meaning and representation. The sakura represents the time of renewal, the new begining, hope and optimism because the cherry tree in japan only blooms for a short time which always signalled the beginning of spring and the fiscal year. The cherry blossom are also a symbol of  life and death which symbolizes the fragility of life because the japanese believe that something is beautiful because it has an end.

I used simple shapes such as pentagon, circles and triangle to give petals an irregular and unique shape and used hexagram for the stamens of the flower which could also resembles the Bahai symbol of the nine-pointed star that reflects the importance of the number for the Faith. I also used the color platte of a cherry blossom tree to attract attention and to resemble the sakura flower.
